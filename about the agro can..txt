1)Me and my frnd has a thought that why farmers can't get the money of their product as they should get.


2)So we decided to create a website that website hepls them to direct contact with product needed bussinessman,so they can provide them 
sufficent money according to their product.

3)As farmer no need to sell their good product at fixed rate these will help in india's economy.becuase goverment no need to wrory about 
farmer's.

4)Also the second stage is that i will connect these website through the world so the product of any region can be get by other countires 
easily and farmer also get good rates of it.


5)Now dealing of money will be handle by my company beacuse there are certain bussiness man who can misuse of website and harash the 
farmer.


6)Also beacuse of the export of agriculture products takes place it will boost up the economy of our country and thus these website is 
helpful to both farmers and the country


7)Because the india is a agriculture country these website give a drastic change in making of our country.


8)So basically my happiness lies in the happiness of the well being of the country and there farmers who work hard for the nation to 
full fill our needs.


9)I just want one thing from all of you that is trust and i will make sure our company will never break it in any condition.

10)Also our company take 0.5% from farmer of their product and 1% from the bussiness man if they satiesfied with our website and deal will
complete.
